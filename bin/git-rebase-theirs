	Resolve git rebase conflicts in FILE(s) by favoring 'theirs' version

	When using git rebase, conflicts are usually wanted to be resolved
	by favoring the <working branch> version (the branch being rebased,
	'theirs' side in a rebase), instead of the <upstream> version (the
	base branch, 'ours' side)

	But git rebase --strategy -X theirs is only available from git 1.7.3
	For older versions, $myname is the solution. And Despite the name,
	it's also useful for fixing failed cherry-picks

	It works by discarding all lines between '<<<<<<< ' and '========'
	inclusive, and also the the '>>>>>> commit' marker.

	By default it outputs to stdout, but files can be edited in-place
	using --in-place, which, unlike sed, creates a backup by default.

	Options:
	  -h|--help            show this page.
	  -v|--verbose         print more details in stderr.

	  --in-place[=SUFFIX]  edit files in place, creating a backup with
	                       SUFFIX extension. Default if blank is "$ext"

	  --no-backup          disables backup
